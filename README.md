Finds all lists on page and gives them a pink border.

## Why?
Created out of a common Canada.ca style guide error: punctuation at the end of list items.
This allows for quicker QA, without missing a list.

## Future Features
* Improve popup UX
* Change text on button once function executed
* Notify user if there are no lists on the page
* Display number of lists on page
* Provide links to jump to each list
