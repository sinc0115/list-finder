# List Finder
Finds all lists on page and gives them a pink border.

## Why?
Created out of a common Canada.ca style guide error: punctuation at the end of list items.
This allows for quicker QA, without missing a list.

## Future Features
* Add popup
* Display number of lists on page
* Provide links to jump to each list
